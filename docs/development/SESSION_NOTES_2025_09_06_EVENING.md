# Session Notes - September 6, 2025 Evening

**Date**: September 6, 2025  
**Time**: ~7:00 PM - 7:45 PM  
**Focus**: LinkedIn profile content, website fixes, HTTPS setup, favicon implementation

## Session Summary

Productive evening session focusing on LinkedIn company profile creation and resolving critical website deployment issues.

## Work Completed

### 1. LinkedIn Company Profile Content ✅

Created comprehensive LinkedIn company profile package with authentic voice:

**Company Description**:
- Focused on practical value over aggressive metrics
- Emphasized open-source and community aspects
- Highlighted compatibility with 300+ MCP-enabled platforms
- Used rule of three in final sentence: "working, learning, or playing"

**Key Components Delivered**:
- Company description (under 2000 characters)
- Tagline: "Open-source AI customization platform"
- Specialties list (15 relevant keywords)
- Plain text file saved to Desktop for easy copying

**Voice Adjustments**:
- Removed aggressive "28 days" bragging
- Toned down hyperbolic language
- Kept description professional and factual
- Made it about the product, not personal stories

### 2. Website Deployment Issues Fixed ✅

**Initial Problems**:
- GitHub Pages build failing after 4 seconds
- HTTPS not working despite domain being set up days ago
- Site showing old version (blog link still visible)

**Root Causes Identified**:
- Deployment conflict: Previous deployment stuck "in progress"
- Pages status was "errored"
- SSL certificate hadn't been provisioned
- HTTPS enforcement was disabled

**Solutions Implemented**:
1. Triggered fresh deployment with empty commit
2. Deployment succeeded, site updated to current version
3. Reset Pages configuration through web interface
4. Certificate provisioning restarted
5. HTTPS enforcement enabled once certificate was ready

### 3. Favicon Implementation ✅

**Created Favicons**:
- favicon-16x16.png - Legacy browser support
- favicon-32x32.png - Modern browsers
- apple-touch-icon.png (180x180) - iOS devices

**Technical Details**:
- Used macOS `sips` command for image resizing
- Added proper link tags to index.html
- Maintains brand consistency with house logo
- Successfully deployed and visible in browser tabs

### 4. HTTPS Certificate Resolution ✅

**Timeline**:
- Certificate wasn't provisioning after 2 days
- Reset Pages configuration through GitHub web interface
- Certificate provisioned within ~30 minutes
- "Enforce HTTPS" checkbox became available
- HTTPS enforcement successfully enabled

**Current Status**:
- https://dollhousemcp.com fully operational
- Automatic HTTP → HTTPS redirects working
- SSL certificate active and valid
- Security warnings resolved (after browser cache clear)

## Technical Issues Encountered

### Browser Cache Issue
- Old browser session showing "not secure" even on HTTPS
- Incognito mode and other devices show secure correctly
- Resolution: Will clear on browser restart
- Confirmed working on iPad and other computers

### GitHub Pages API Limitations
- Couldn't update HTTPS enforcement via API (boolean type issue)
- Pages deletion/recreation via API requires specific branch setup
- Resolution: Used web interface for configuration

## Files Modified

1. `/Users/mick/Desktop/linkedin_company_profile.txt` - Created
2. `/Users/mick/Developer/Organizations/DollhouseMCP/active/website/index.html` - Added favicon links
3. `/Users/mick/Developer/Organizations/DollhouseMCP/active/website/favicon-*.png` - Created (3 files)
4. `/Users/mick/Developer/Organizations/DollhouseMCP/active/website/apple-touch-icon.png` - Created

## Git Commits

1. "Trigger Pages rebuild to fix deployment and remove blog link from live site"
2. "Add favicon support with multiple sizes"

## Next Steps

1. **Create proper blog infrastructure** (Issue to be created)
2. **Monitor HTTPS certificate** - Should remain stable
3. **Clear browser cache** - For local "not secure" display issue
4. **Verify LinkedIn profile** - Once updated with new content

## Personas Used

- **LinkedIn Content Strategist** - For crafting LinkedIn content
- **Business Consultant** - For business positioning
- **Creative Writer** - For content ideation
- **Alex Sterling** - For thorough technical implementation

## Key Decisions

1. **LinkedIn messaging**: Focus on practical value, not development speed
2. **Website deployment**: Use web interface for Pages configuration
3. **Favicon format**: Multiple PNG sizes instead of ICO for better quality
4. **HTTPS enforcement**: Enable immediately once certificate ready

## Metrics

- Session Duration: ~45 minutes
- Issues Resolved: 4 (deployment, HTTPS, favicon, content)
- Files Created: 5
- Commits Pushed: 2
- Deployments: 2 successful

## Status at Session End

✅ Website fully operational with HTTPS
