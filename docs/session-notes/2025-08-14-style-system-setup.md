# Session Notes: DollhouseMCP Website Style System Setup
**Date:** August 14, 2025  
**Focus:** Initial website setup, style guide creation, and design system implementation

## Overview
This session focused on establishing the foundation for the DollhouseMCP website, creating a comprehensive style system based on existing mockups and sprite sheets, and building a style guide for future development.

## Key Accomplishments

### 1. Project Structure Setup
- Created organized folder structure for the website repository
- Established directories for styles, mockups, icons, and documentation
- Set up modular CSS architecture with separate files for tokens, base styles, components, and utilities

### 2. Design System Creation

#### Design Tokens (`styles/tokens.css`)
- **Color System**: Updated from initial purple to blue (#1e40af) to match mockup
- **Typography Scale**: 11 size levels from xs to 7xl
- **Spacing System**: Consistent scale from 2px to 160px
- **Shadows**: 7 levels for different elevation needs
- **Animation**: Standard durations and easing functions
- **Dark Mode Support**: Full theme switching with CSS custom properties

#### Base Styles (`styles/base.css`)
- CSS reset and normalization
- Typography base styles
- Form element styling
- Accessibility features (focus states, screen reader classes)
- Scrollbar customization

#### Component Library (`styles/components.css`)
- Buttons (primary, secondary, outline, ghost)
- Cards (standard, feature, library styles)
- Badges (6 color variants)
- Alerts (info, success, warning, error)
- Forms (inputs, labels, validation states)
- Modals with overlay
- Navigation components
- Code blocks with syntax highlighting
- Loading states (spinners, progress bars)
- Grid systems (2, 3, 4 column responsive)

### 3. Mockup Integration

#### From Multi-page Mockup
- Extracted design patterns and color schemes
- Implemented specific components:
  - Dollhouse 3D visual with room grid
  - Library cards with gradient icons
  - Category tabs (pill style)
  - GitHub star buttons
  - Stats sections with gradient backgrounds
  - Pricing cards with feature lists
  - Hero sections with version badges

#### From Sprite Sheet
- Extracted and implemented house icon system
- Created 26+ color schemes including:
  - Standard colors (blue, purple, green, etc.)
  - Retro gaming themes (Gameboy, NES, Commodore, Terminal)
- Built multiple size variants (small 32px, default 48px, large 64px)
- Added interactive states (hover, animated, loading)

### 4. House Icon System Development

#### Original Implementation (`styles/house-icons.css`)
- Base house structure with roof, body, rooms, foundation
- Modular color schemes using CSS custom properties
- Animation effects (floating, pulsing rooms, build-in)
- Interactive hover states

#### Modified Version (`styles/house-icons-modified.css`)
- **Curved edges**: Body and rooms have border-radius to match modern design
- **Left-side chimney**: Positioned behind roof for depth (z-index layering)
- **Terminal style fix**: Horizontal lines instead of squashed grid
- **Organization icon match**: Attempted CSS recreation of official PNG

#### Key Design Decisions
- Chimney placed behind roof line for better depth perception
- Curved body edges (4-6px radius) matching interior room curves
- Square-edged foundation (no border-radius)
- White background inside house body with blue border
- Squircle-shaped rooms (25% border-radius)
- Terminal style with glowing green foundation

### 5. Official Assets Integration
- Added official DollhouseMCP organization icon (`icons/Dollhouse-org.png`)
- Created CSS recreation attempts for flexibility
- Acknowledged PNG as preferred for accuracy, CSS for interactive states

### 6. Style Guide Creation (`style-guide.html`)
- Comprehensive demonstration page showing all components
- Interactive theme switching (light/dark modes)
- Side-by-side comparisons of original vs modified designs
- Live examples of all design system elements
- Color swatches with hex values
- Typography samples with specifications
- Spacing visualization
- Component playground for testing

## Technical Decisions

### CSS Architecture
- **Modular approach**: Separate files for different concerns
- **CSS Custom Properties**: Extensive use for theming and consistency
- **BEM-inspired naming**: Clear, semantic class names
- **Utility classes**: Quick styling helpers following Tailwind-like patterns

### Browser Support
- Modern CSS features (custom properties, grid, flexbox)
- Progressive enhancement approach
- Fallbacks for older browsers where needed

### Performance Considerations
- System fonts for optimal loading
- CSS-only components where possible
- Minimal dependencies

## Challenges & Solutions

### Challenge 1: Matching the Mockup Design
**Solution**: Carefully extracted colors and patterns from the mockup, updating from initial purple theme to blue (#1e40af) to match exactly.

### Challenge 2: Terminal Icon Squashing
**Solution**: Instead of squashing the entire house grid, created horizontal lines representing terminal text while maintaining proper house proportions.

### Challenge 3: CSS Recreation of PNG Icon
**Solution**: While perfect recreation proved challenging, created a close approximation with acknowledgment that PNG should be used for accuracy, CSS for interactive needs.

### Challenge 4: Grid System Not Displaying
**Solution**: Added missing grid classes that were referenced but not defined.

## Next Steps & Recommendations

### Immediate Tasks
1. Create actual landing page using the style system
2. Implement responsive navigation component
3. Build out additional page templates
4. Add JavaScript for interactivity (theme persistence, modal controls)

### Future Enhancements
1. Component documentation with usage examples
2. Accessibility audit and improvements
3. Performance optimization (CSS minification, critical CSS)
4. Animation library for micro-interactions
5. Form validation styles and states
6. Additional color themes beyond light/dark

### Maintenance Notes
- Style guide should be updated whenever new components are added
- Design tokens should remain the single source of truth for values
- Consider creating a living pattern library
- Document any deviations from the original mockup

## Session Summary

Successfully established a robust, scalable design system for the DollhouseMCP website. The system provides a solid foundation for building out the full site while maintaining consistency and allowing for future growth. The style guide serves as both documentation and a testing ground for new components.

## Additional Notes

### Design Philosophy
- **Modular & Scalable**: Every component is built to be reusable and extensible
- **Brand Consistency**: Blue color scheme (#1e40af) established as primary brand color
- **Playful Yet Professional**: House icons provide personality while maintaining technical credibility
- **Accessibility First**: Focus states, semantic HTML, and ARIA considerations built in from the start

### Key Learnings
1. **CSS Recreation Limitations**: While CSS can approximate complex icons, PNG assets remain superior for brand accuracy
2. **Terminal Aesthetics**: Creative interpretation (horizontal lines vs squashed grid) can improve visual clarity
3. **Squircles > Ovals**: Rounded squares (squircles) provide better visual balance than pure circles or squares
4. **Depth Through Layering**: Z-index positioning (chimney behind roof) adds dimensionality to flat designs

### Assets Ready for Production
- ✅ Complete color system with dark mode
- ✅ Typography scale tested and balanced
- ✅ Component library covering common UI patterns
- ✅ House icon system with 26+ variations
- ✅ Official organization icon integrated
- ✅ Interactive style guide for reference
- ✅ Responsive grid systems
- ✅ Form styles with validation states
- ✅ Loading and animation patterns

### Quick Start for Next Session
1. Open `style-guide.html` in browser to review all components
2. Check `styles/main.css` for the import structure
3. Use `styles/tokens.css` for any new color/spacing needs
4. Reference this document for design decisions and rationale

### Final Thoughts
The foundation is solid and ready for building out the actual website pages. The modular CSS architecture will make it easy to maintain consistency while allowing for creative expression where needed. The style guide will be invaluable for onboarding and ensuring design consistency across the project.
